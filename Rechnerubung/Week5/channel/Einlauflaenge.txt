x_e = 0.0061

When du_x/dx first equals 0, the criterion is reached.
u_x stays unchanged for long, indicating formation of fully developed velocity profile in laminar flow.

I ran the command: postProcess -func "grad(U)"
I opened the simulation in paraview and selected grad_0(U) to display du_x/dx
I then used PlotoverLine and determined the graph
Finally, I extrapolated the necessary data: when grad_0(U) first reaches 0.
