x_e = 0.0061

When du_x/dx first equals 0, the criterion is reached.
u_x stays unchanged for long, indicating formation of fully developed velocity profile in laminar flow.

I ran the command: postProcess -func "grad(U)"
I opened the simulation in paraview and selected grad_0(U) to display du_x/dx
I then used PlotoverLine and determined the graph
Finally, I extrapolated the necessary data: when grad_0(U) first reaches 0.

**graph,csv, and screenshot of table is included in the folder

!!!I learnt how to create the grad(U) graph with python. First I sampled grad(U), then created the graph. Now I can extrapolate the same way by viewing the sampled data.
