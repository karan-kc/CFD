The time-averaged velocity profile of turbulent flow is flatter than its laminar flow equivalent.
This is due to a mixing of layers that homogenizes the difference in velocity.
The steep drop at the edges of the graph is due to the viscous sublayer and the no-slip condition at the top and bottom walls.
