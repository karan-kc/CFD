Since the Reynolds Number is quite low ~100 and the problem is a transient one, I used the laminar model with pisoFoam.

I have 2 cores that I'm able to use.

With parallel processing the simulation takes 16 seconds.
Without parallel processing the simulation takes 30 seconds.
A reduction in time ~50%, which makes sense considering I used double the cores.
I got these times from the log files. (These are the simulation times and don't include the time for creating the mesh nor decomposePar/reconstructPar)
As a result of the extra overhead needed for parallel_processing, the times in practice are closer. If the simulation was longer, using the extra cores would be time-saving.
