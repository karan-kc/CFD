## The Xcompact3d code

Xcompact3d is a Fortran-MPI based, finite difference high-performance code for solving the
incompressible or low Mach number Navier-Stokes equations with an arbitrary number of scalar transport
equations.

This repository contains a major upgrade in the Xcompact3d code. The new version is faster, more flexible and user friendly.

The main homepage for the original Incompact3d can be found at [incompact3d.com](https://www.incompact3d.com/). You can find a list of the work related to the code.

This is the GitHub repository of Xcompact3d source code, including instructions for running and compiling Xcompact3d, below.

### Benchmark test cases for code comparison ###

We estabilished a solid and easy way to run a range of benchmark test cases to verify the
code.
Xcompact3d now supports multiple cases, selectable at runtime in the parameter file input.i3d,
including a user-defined case (note this will require editing the setup in src/BC-User.f90 and
recompiling, check the other setup files src/BC-*.f90 for guidance).
The following cases are set to match the parameters for cases of
reference articles obtained with different codes.

N.B. Other cases are in preparation.

## New compiling FLAGS

   -DDOUBLE_PREC - use double-precision
   -DSAVE_SINGLE - save 3D data in single-precision
   -DDEBG        - debuggin incompact3d.f90

**Note:** In order to compile the code with the apropiate flags you must enter the -D$FLAG, i.e., -DDOUBLE_PREC

# Compiled code performance

Xcompact3d is designed to run on laptops/workstations up to large clusters. We support the gfortran, ifort and ftn compilers
which can be selected at compile time by

   make CMP=gcc
   make CMP=intel
   make CMP=cray
   
respectively (it will default to gfortran otherwise). Note that we use gfortran for development, therefore not all optimisations are enabled by default - if you want to perform production runs using gfortran, adding -O3 to the FFLAGS for CMP=gcc should provide a significant speed up.

## Source Download and Compilation

First, make sure you have all the [required dependencies](#required-build-tools-and-external-libraries) installed.
Then, acquire the source code by cloning the git repository:

    git clone git@github.com:xcompact3d/Incompact3d.git

(If you are behind a firewall, you may need to use the `https` protocol instead of the `git` protocol:

    git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git@

Be sure to also configure your system to use the appropriate proxy settings, e.g. by setting the `https_proxy` and `http_proxy` variables.)

By default you will be building the latest master version of Xcompact3d, to use the release preview you must checkout the release branch

    git checkout release

Now run `make` to build the `Xcompact3d` executable. To perform a parallel build, use `make -j N` and supply the maximum number of concurrent processes. (See [Platform Specific Build Notes] for details.)
This takes a while, but only has to be done once. If the defaults in the build do not work for you, and you need to set specific make parameters, you can save them in `Make.user`. The build will automatically check for the existence of `Makefile` and use it if it exists.
Building Xcompact3d requires very little of disk space and virtual memory.

**Note:** The compiling process 

Once it is built, you can run the `Xcompact3d` executable using its full path in the directory created above (the `Xcompact3d` directory).

Now you should be able to run Xcompact3d like this:

    mpirun -n 4 ./xcompact3d ./examples/<EXAMPLE>/input.i3d

If a input.i3d file is not provide, xcompact3d will look for it locally (i.e. try to load ./input.i3d).

If everything works correctly, you will see a Xcompact3d banner and an interactive prompt into which you can enter expressions for evaluation. (Errors related to libraries might be caused by old, incompatible libraries sitting around in your PATH. In this case, try moving the `Xcompact3d` directory earlier in the PATH).

### Updating an existing source tree

If you have previously downloaded `incompact3d` using `git clone`, you can update the
existing source tree using `git pull` rather than starting anew:

    cd incompact3d
    git pull && make

Assuming that you had made no changes to the source tree that will conflict
with upstream updates, these commands will trigger a build to update to the
latest version.

#### General troubleshooting

1. Over time, the base library may accumulate enough changes such that the
   bootstrapping process in building the system image will fail. If this
   happens, the build may fail with an error like

   ```sh
    *** This error is usually fixed by running 'make clean'. If the error persists, try 'make cleanall' ***
   ```
   As described, running `make clean && make` is usually sufficient. Occasionally, the stronger cleanup done by `make cleanall` is needed.


## Platform-Specific Notes

### Linux

#### General

* GCC version 4.7 or later is required to compile the code.

We recommended that you remove the limits of the environment (e.g. in `.bash_profile`)

    ulimit -c unlimited
    ulimit -s unlimited

You must exit and re-login from your terminal for the change to take effect

    ulimit -a

#### Architecture Customization

Xcompact3d can be compiled for a non-generic architecture by configuring the `ARCH` Makefile variable. See the appropriate section of `Makefile` for additional customization options, such as `MARCH` and `CPU_TARGET`. You can also set `march=native` for a maximum-performance build customized for the current machine CPU.

#### Ubuntu

In order to compile and execute Xcompact3d in the latest Ubuntu version please install the following packages:

    sudo apt install gfortran libopenmpi-dev

#### Fedora/RHEL/CentOS

On RHEL/CentOS 6 systems:

    sudo dnf install gcc-gfortran

### OS X

You need to have the current Xcode command line utilities installed: run `xcode-select --install` in the terminal.
You will need to rerun this terminal command after each OS X update, otherwise you may run into errors involving missing libraries or headers. You will also need a 64-bit gfortran to compile the code. The gfortran-4.7 (and newer) compilers in Brew, Fink, and MacPorts work for building Xcompact3d. On current systems, we recommend that you install the command line tools as described above. Older systems do not have a separate command line tools package from Apple, and will require a full Xcode install. On these, you will need at least Xcode 4.3.3. In Xcode prior to v5.0, you can alternatively go to Preferences -> Downloads and select the Command Line Utilities.
